<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Rachel Schischka and I live in New Zealand. I have two cats who I love very much and I enjoy playing video games.</p>

<p>I'm currently studing web development on Udemy. I hope to be a web developer in the future!</p>

<p>I have previously graduated from Yoobee School of Design with a Diploma in Advanced 3D Graphics specializing in character animation. You can find my blog with my old 3D work <a href="https://rachelschischka.blogspot.com/">here</a>.</p>
